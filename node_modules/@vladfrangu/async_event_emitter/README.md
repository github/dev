## Description

A very small, lightweight and simple re-implementation of event emitters, with support for async event handlers in mind.

> **Note**: `@vladfrangu/async_event_emitter` requires Node.js v14 or higher to work, or a browser that has async/await support.

## Features

-   TypeScript friendly
-   Offers CJS, ESM and UMD builds
-   Consistent interface with what is expected from an event emitter
-   Simple handling of asynchronous event handlers to allow waiting for their execution to finish if you want to exit the process
