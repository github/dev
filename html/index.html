        <h1>Mathematical Proofs</h1>
        <p class="first">There is a notable difference between mathematics and the sciences. In the sciences, in order
            for something to be accepted, there must be almost no doubt that it is true. This makes logical sense:
            Chemists and Physicists deal with objects so minutes they are practically immeasurable. In mathematics,
            however, there cannot be any doubt at all. Take the following proposition:</p>
        <p class="quote">There exist an infinite number of prime numbers.</p>
        <p>To address this the experimental way simply would not work, becuase no matter how many prime numbers you
            find, you could never be certain that there was not one more. Mathematically, however, this can be proven
            rather elegantly, using one of the most famous proofs ever created.</p>
