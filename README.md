# What is this?

The github.dev web-based editor is a lightweight editing experience that runs entirely in your browser. You can navigate files and source code repositories from GitHub, and make and commit code changes.

Press the `.` key on any repository or pull request, or swap `.com` with `.dev` in the URL, to go directly to a VS Code environment in your browser.

To get started coding and adding files, try out the `.` key on any of your repos or PRs. You can also check out [http://github.dev/microsoft/vscode](http://github.dev/microsoft/vscode) as an example of github.dev in action. 

Preview the gif below to get a quick demo of github.dev in action.

# Why?
It’s a quick way to edit and navigate code. It's especially useful if you want to edit multiple files at a time or take advantage of all the powerful code editing features of Visual Studio Code when making a quick change. For more information, see our [documentation](https://github.co/codespaces-editor-help).
